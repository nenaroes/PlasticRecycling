# PlasticRecycling
This is an ABM project on plastic recycling policies within Dutch municipalities. 

Households produce waste, municipalities collect it and sign the contracts with firms. 
Firms recycle plastic waste and make profit out of it. 
The Dutch government is looking for the trade-offs betwteen spendings and achieved recycling rates.

In this research the following research question has the main focus:
Does the current organization of plastic waste management and recycling in The Netherlands lead to the desired results or is it necessary to make (significant) changes?
